# Stream Deck Visualizer

This plugin is used is used to visualize audio input / output from any sound device you have attached to your PC.

Pre-requisites. 
   * Install the latest version of [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
To install, clone or download the repo, and build it.

I have submitted this to the Elgato marketplace, so most people should install it from there after it's been accepted.
